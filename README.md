# FullStack Open part 10 - React Native

This repository contains my submissions for the React Native part of the course Full Stack Open 2022. See more [here!](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part10)

In this part focus is on how to build native Android and iOS mobile applications with JavaScript and React using the React Native framework. Along the way, concepts such as how to render native user interface components with React Native, how to create beautiful user interfaces, how to communicate with a server, and how to test a React Native application are studied.
